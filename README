HMN_CE_fast.m is the main program.
It performs CV runs of the following algorithms on the selected dataset:
1-NN 
HMN-E, HMN-C, 1-NN (OTHER = 1 in code to select this algorithm and 1-NN), 
HMN-EI (prova = 1), 
Wilson (Wil = 1), 
ICF (ICF_t = 1), 
DROP3 (drop3 = 1) 


To select a dataset set the corresponding variable to 1, 
for instance with irisd = 1; you will use the iris dataset

The variable more_runs is used to specify if full CV will be performed (more_runs =1) or only one run (more_runs = 0)

results of HMN_CE_fast (accuracy and %removed ) are in the following variables


tot_nn (1-nn)
tot_hmnedit tot_red (HMN-E)
tot_hmn tot_r (HMN-C)
tot_nnicf tot_ricf (ICF)
tot_wil tot_rwil (Wilson)
tot_nndrop tot_rdrop (DROP3)
tot_hmn1 tot_rhmn1 (HMN-EI)
